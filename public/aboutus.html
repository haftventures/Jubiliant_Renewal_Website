        <h2 class="text-center font-bold text-xl sm:text-2xl mb-6 text-gray-800">About Us</h2><br>

        <p>
            We, <strong>Jubiliant Insurance Broking Services Pvt Ltd</strong>, are an Insurance Broking and Consulting firm
            established in the year 2015. Our steady and successful journey is largely due to our excellent relationship
            with industry fraternity on one end, and satisfied clientele on the other.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the nascent phase, our focus has been on understanding customer expectations and fine-tuning our operations
            to cater to the dynamic demands of the industry. Be it individuals, small firms or big corporate houses, our
            clients are a delighted lot.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3><strong>Our Values</strong></h3>

        <h4><strong>Integrity</strong></h4>
        <p>
            We conduct our business with integrity. We establish the highest level of business ethics in our dealings with
            our customers and partners.
        </p>

        <h4><strong>Innovation</strong></h4>
        <p>
            We inspire innovation in all facets of our work. Our success is a result of exploring new approaches and
            concepts beyond conventional methods.
        </p>

        <h4><strong>Passion</strong></h4>
        <p>
            We are passionate about who we are and what we do. We strongly believe that people who are focused,
            self-motivated and inspired by what they do, transform their passion to others.
        </p>

        <h4><strong>Customer First</strong></h4>
        <p>
            We prioritise our customers above everything else. Their needs guide our decisions, processes, and service
            delivery to ensure complete satisfaction.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3><strong>Insurance at Your Convenience</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Gone are the days when people were physically visiting insurance companies for renewal, premium payment and
            other service requirements. Agents were an integral part of the insurance ecosystem and were acting as trusted
            intermediaries. But times have changed and now it is the brokers who act on behalf of their clients (the actual
            customers who buy insurance).
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3><strong>Our Milestones</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Our awareness and adept mindset led to our evolution and development of new capabilities enabling us to thrive
            in the ever-changing insurance landscape. In a period when people were looking for convenient insurance buying
            options, we were the first to introduce <strong>Insurance Kiosks</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We quickly expanded this prototype in organised retail stores across Tamil Nadu for ease of access to individual
            customers. We are now one of the pioneers in this insurance business model with our footprints across the country.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3><strong>Our Uniqueness</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Corporates usually spend time and efforts in the core production and execution activities such as sales &
            marketing, supply chain, logistics, finance, human resource management etc. There usually isn’t expertise and
            focus with respect to risk assessment and insurance solutions. This is where we come in.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are a trustworthy resource guiding our corporates in deciding the best insurance solutions for them. We also
            provide them with the best-in-the-industry risk assessment and consulting services, support them with policy
            placement solutions and also offer TAT-specified claim processing. We also proactively offer other insurance-
            related consulting & solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, we are associated with multiple corporates and are proud to be an integral part of their journey to
            success. Industry reference plays a vital factor in the growth of our corporate clientele base.
